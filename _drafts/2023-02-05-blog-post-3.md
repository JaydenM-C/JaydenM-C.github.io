On Australia Day, 26 January 2023, my family received the news that my late grandfather, Neville, had been awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM), in recognition of service to the community of Kangaroo Island.

Neville, or Poppa as I knew him, founded the _Islander_ newspaper, which [ennumerated his many accomplishments](https://www.theislanderonline.com.au/story/8062265/the-islander-founder-neville-cordes-receives-oam-in-2023-australia-day-honours-list/) and contributions to Kangaroo Island life and society. See also this [rich and colourful description](https://www.theislanderonline.com.au/story/7521488/vale-neville-cordes-kangaroo-island-newspaperman/) of his life and upbringing, as penned by my father, Greg, after his death in late 2021.

Sharing such a personal thing publically is not something that comes naturally to me. However, Poppa was one of my greatest inspirations and role models and I owe a great deal to him for shaping the principles I try to live by today.
